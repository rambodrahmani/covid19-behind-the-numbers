# COVID-19: Behind the Numbers
![Cover Image](cover.jpeg)
At the beginning of 2020, a new virus started spreading around in the capital of
Central China's Hubei province: the city we all came to know as Wuhan. As it
turned out, this was the start of a world-changing event with overwhelming
extent: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). After the first wave of the virus
has passed over the entire world, the aim of this work is to address the
following questions:
* Which countries have been affected the most by COVID-19?
* Which governments have taken the right actions to stop the spreading of the virus?
* Is it possible to build personalized predictive models for symptomatic COVID-19 patients based on basic health preconditions?
