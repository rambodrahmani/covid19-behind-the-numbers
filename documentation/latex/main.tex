\section{Introduction}
\textbf{Decemebr 31, 2019}: \textit{Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, China,
reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel
coronavirus was eventually identified.}\\
\textbf{January 1, 2020}: \textit{World Health Organization (WHO) had set up the
Incident Management Support Team across the three levels of the organization:
headquarters, regional headquarters and country level, putting the organization
on an emergency footing for dealing with the outbreak.}\\
\textbf{January 5, 2020}: \textit{WHO published the first Disease Outbreak News
on the new virus. This was a flagship technical publication to the scientific
and public health community as well as global media.}\\
\textbf{January 12, 2020}: \textit{China publicly shared the genetic sequence of
COVID-19.}\\
\\
At the beginning of 2020, a new virus started spreading around China. As it
turned out, this was the start of a world-changing event with overwhelming
extent. After the first wave of the virus has passed over the entire world, the
aim of this work is to address the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Which countries have been affected the most by COVID-19?
	\item Which governments have taken the right actions to stop the
		spreading of the virus?
	\item Is it possible to build personalized predictive models for
		symptomatic COVID-19 patients based on basic preconditions?
\end{itemize}
In order to fully answer these questions, first of all a reliable and big enough
dataset was needed. Second, Data Mining and Machine Learning techniques were
applied in order to obtain statistically significant results that could help
address the proposed questions. In the following pages the described work and
the resulting Python software is presented. The software architecture is
presented in the very last section in order to focus primarily on the dataset
retrieval and preprocessing, and on the analysis techniques and results.
